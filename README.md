TASK 1:  TO-DO LIST üìù
Task Overview:
A To-Do List application is a useful project that helps users manage and organize their tasks efficiently. This project aims to create a
command-line application using Python, allowing users to create, update, and track their to-do lists.
Features:
1. Task Creation: Users can add new tasks with a command.
2. Task Updating: Users can update existing tasks, such as editing task details.
3. Task Deletion: Users can remove tasks from their to-do list.
4. Task Viewing: Users can view all tasks present in the list.

TASK 2: CALCULATOR üì±
Task Overview:
The Simple Calculator project aims to design an application that performs basic arithmetic operations. Users will be prompted to input two numbers and select an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, modulus or division). The application will then execute the chosen operation and display the result.
Features:
1. Input Handling: Prompt the user to input two numbers.
2. Operation Selection: Allow the user to choose an arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, modulus, division).
3. Calculation: Perform the selected operation on the input numbers.
4. Result Display: Display the result of the calculation.

TASK 3: PASSWORD GENERATORüîë
Task Overview:
The Password Generator project aims to create a Python-based application that generates strong, random passwords for users. This tool enhances security by allowing users to specify the desired length and complexity of their passwords, including options for uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
Features:
1. User Input: Prompt the user to specify the desired length of the password.
2. Generate Password: Use a combination of random characters to generate a password of the specified length.
3. Display the Password: Print the generated password on the screen.

TASK 4: ROCK, PAPER, SCISSOR GAMEüéÆ 
Task Overview:
The Rock-Paper-Scissors Game project involves creating a Python application where the user is prompted to choose between rock, paper, or scissors. The computer generates a random choice, and the game logic determines the winner based on the standard rules: rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock.
Features:
1. User Input: Prompt the user to choose rock, paper, or scissors.
2. Computer Selection: Generate a random choice (rock, paper, or scissors) for the computer.
3. Game Logic: Determine the winner based on the user's choice and the computer's choice (rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock).
4. Display Result: Show the user's choice, the computer's choice, and the game result (win, lose, or tie).
5. Play Again: Ask the user if they want to play another round.
   
TASK 5:  CONTACT LISTüìï
Task Overview:
The Contact Management System project aims to create a Python application for storing and managing contact information, including name, phone number, email, and address. This project involves creating a Python application to manage contact information efficiently. 
Features:
1. Contact Information: Store detailed contact information, including name, phone number, email, and address for each contact.
2. Add Contact: Allow users to add new contacts with their details.
3. View Contact List: Display a list of all saved contacts, showing names and phone numbers.
4. Search Contact: Implement a search function to find contacts by name or phone number.
5. Update Contact: Enable users to update existing contact details.
6. Delete Contact: Provide an option to delete a contact.
7. User Interface: Design a user-friendly interface for easy interaction.
